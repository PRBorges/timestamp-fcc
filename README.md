# Timestamp Microservice

This is the [timestamp project](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/apis-and-microservices/apis-and-microservices-projects/timestamp-microservice) required for the Backend certification from FreeCodeCamp.

It returns a timestamp in JSON  with the epoch milliseconds and the date as a string in GMT.

The file api.js was created by me.
The rest of the files come from the [boilerplate repo](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/boilerplate-project-timestamp/) from FCC.
I added a few lines to index.js and index.html.

Endpoints:

* /api/year/month/day returns the given date.
* /api/milliseconds returns the date for the givven epoch ms.
* /api/dateString returns the given date.
* /api returns the current date.

The project was submitted to FCC [as a replit](https://replit.com/@PRBorges/TimestampAPIFCC). It should be live at [https://TimestampAPIFCC.prborges.repl.co](https://TimestampAPIFCC.prborges.repl.co).
